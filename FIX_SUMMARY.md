# Fix Summary: 403 Forbidden Error

## Problem

The Python script (`script.py`) was receiving a **403 Forbidden** error when attempting to search for anime using the Anslayer API:

```
Error searching anime: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://anslayer.com/anime/public/animes/get-published-animes?json=...
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was identified by analyzing the decompiled Android APK's smali files, specifically:

**File:** `/home/runner/work/smali/smali/unzipped/smali/a4/a.smali` (ClientInterceptor)

This file contains the OkHttp interceptor that adds required authentication headers to all API requests.

### Key Findings from Smali Analysis

Lines 117-129 of `a4/a.smali` show the required headers:

```smali
const-string v2, "Client-Id"
const-string v3, "android-app2"
invoke-virtual {v1, v2, v3}, Lokhttp3/Request$Builder;->addHeader(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lokhttp3/Request$Builder;

const-string v2, "Client-Secret"
const-string v3, "7befba6263cc14c90d2f1d6da2c5cf9b251bfbbd"
invoke-virtual {v1, v2, v3}, Lokhttp3/Request$Builder;->addHeader(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lokhttp3/Request$Builder;

const-string v2, "Accept"
const-string v3, "application/json"
invoke-virtual {v1, v2, v3}, Lokhttp3/Request$Builder;->addHeader(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lokhttp3/Request$Builder;
```

## Solution

### Changes Made

1. **Updated `script.py`** (Lines 25-33):
   - Added `Client-Id: android-app2` header
   - Added `Client-Secret: 7befba6263cc14c90d2f1d6da2c5cf9b251bfbbd` header

2. **Updated `results.md`**:
   - Added new "Required Headers" section under Authentication
   - Documented all required headers found in the smali analysis

3. **Updated `EXAMPLES.md`**:
   - Added required headers to all curl command examples
   - Updated authentication section with complete header requirements

4. **Updated `SUMMARY.txt`**:
   - Added note about required headers in Key Discoveries
   - Added header requirements to Technical Details section

### Required Headers

All API requests now include:

```python
{
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10) AppleWebKit/537.36',
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Client-Id': 'android-app2',
    'Client-Secret': '7befba6263cc14c90d2f1d6da2c5cf9b251bfbbd',
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
}
```

## Files Modified

1. `script.py` - Added missing authentication headers
2. `results.md` - Documented header requirements
3. `EXAMPLES.md` - Updated all curl examples with headers
4. `SUMMARY.txt` - Added authentication findings

## Testing

Due to network restrictions in the development environment, live testing against the API was not possible. However, the changes are based on direct analysis of the Android app's actual HTTP client configuration, ensuring they match exactly what the official app uses.

## Impact

This fix should resolve the 403 Forbidden error by including the proper authentication headers that the API requires to identify and authorize requests from the application.

## Additional Notes

- The `Client-Id` and `Client-Secret` are application-level credentials (not user credentials)
- These headers are required for all API requests, including public endpoints
- For authenticated user requests, an additional `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header may be needed
- The token can be obtained through the login endpoint documented in `results.md`

## Commits

1. `200f1cc` - Initial plan
2. `d263e7f` - Add required API authentication headers from smali analysis
3. `fc5353e` - Update documentation with required API headers
